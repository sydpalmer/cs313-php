		<p>My name is Sydney Palmer. I started out in the mechanical engineering program, but after two years, I decided that there was just too much physics and I switched over to Software Engineering.</p>

			I've been married for two and a half years. My husband and I are expecting our first child this July. I enjoy reading, crocheting, and writing fantasy or sci-fi(mostly short stories). As you can see, I like Pokémon. I didn't get to play much as a child, so I get to "relive" my childhood through Pokémon Go. My favorite color is purple, but I don't like many things that are purple, so most people think my favorite color is blue. My favorite animals are dolphins and monkeys. I want to be a published author some day. As a backup career, I would pick to be an app programmer/designer; I've always liked the possibilities that you can have with different apps, and ever since CS246, I've really been more anxious to do more.
