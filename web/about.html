         <p id="aboutPar">
      I was born in Redlands, California to a family of four. Soon after, we became a family of 6. When I was 3, my family moved to Nibley, Utah where we happily lived for 8 years. After 4th grade, we moved again to Great Falls, Montana. This is when I first picked up crochet.

      My sister received a crochet kit for her birthday and I was soon facinated by her gift. I asked my grandfather to teach me how to crochet. Sadly, we did not live close by my grandparents, so I ended up teaching myself. I started off crocheting hot pads, scarves, and bags. After a bit of practice, and youtube tutorials, I learned how to do more complicated things. My room is never without at least two balls of yarn. 
         </p>

      After I learned to crochet, I wanted to learn more things. I learned how to sew in 7th grade and continued up through my last year of high school. On top of that, I taught myself how to knit using a loom. Now, I am in college and continue to make things from scratch. It's one of my most favorite hobbies besides reading.

      I'm married now and have about two years left at BYU-Idaho under the Software Engineering Program. My husband and I manage a duplex in our spare time (when we aren't in class). We hope to have a few children of our own in the near future.
